# PillBot
The main idea of the project is to build an automated pill dispenser that reads information from a file and dispenses a certain number of pills at different times throughout the day. There has been a vast increase in diseases and medications as the field of medicine advances. Therefore, it
has become increasingly difficult to keep up with the number of pills one has to take to stay healthy and
alive. It is also especially difficult for those of old age to keep track of their daily medications as the older
they get, the more they must take at different times. Therefore, the group aimed to address this issue by
designing a robot that would take this tedious task and make it much simpler. The robotic system the
group hopes to develop will accurately and conveniently determine the correct amount of each pill
specified by the user beforehand and dispense that amount at given times in the span of a day. This will
vastly aid those of older age as it will remove the trouble of organizing, counting, and remembering the
different types and quantities of pills every day.
